                <h4>SOFTWARE | VULNERABILITY | SCAN | NETWORKS</h4>
                <p>It is a software designed to analyze available WiFi networks. Upon selecting a specific network,
                    the software can perform the following functions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>• Scan the network to detect <span>connected devices.</span></li>
                    <li>• Identify the <span>operating system</span> of each device.</li>
                    <li>• Assess the <span>vulnerabilities</span> of connected devices, if possible.</li>
                    <li>• Use a <span>Raspberry Pi</span> for data collection.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>It is for individuals who are <span>passionate</span> about <span>cybersecurity</span> and want
                    to add an extra layer of <span>security</span> to their networks by performing <span>daily
                        diagnostics</span> to enhance the <span>safety</span> of their WiFi.</p>

                <h4>FROM AN IDEA TO A PROJECT</h4>
                <p>It began as a <span>mere idea</span>, but after giving it some thought, we realized it would be a
                    <span>great project</span> for the thesis we needed to present. We conducted research until we
                    could <span>solidify this fantastic concept.</span> The more we studied the topic, the more
                    passionate we became about developing <span>this project for the community.</span>
